#  OneSignal Push Notifications for Laravel 5

# WARNING!
This project is not actively maintained as of 2018/12/12. I'd strongly urge you to consider a package that is, like `berkayk/onesignal-laravel`

## Introduction

This project is a wrapper for the OneSignal v1 API.  It supports all operations currently supported by the API.

## Installation (Laravel and Lumen)

Require the package with composer.

```sh
composer require jmrieger/onesignal-laravel
composer update
```

## Laravel Users:
Update `config/app.php` by adding the following entries.
```php
'providers' => [
	// ...
	jmrieger\OneSignal\OneSignalServiceProvider::class
];

'aliases' => [
   	// ...
   	'OneSignal' => jmrieger\OneSignal\OneSignalFacade::class
   ];
```

## Lumen Users:
update `bootstrap/app.php`, adding the following entry
```php
$app->register( \jmrieger\OneSignal\OneSignalServiceProvider::class );
class_alias( 'jmrieger\OneSignal\OneSignalFacade', 'OneSignal' );
```


## Configuration
There are 3 settings that need to be updated: your default OneSignal app ID, the REST API key, and the User Auth Key.  All of these items can be found in your Control Panel on the OneSignal site.

First, publish the onesignal config: 
```
php artisan vendor:publish
```

Place the 3 keys into your .env file, as such:
```
ONESIGNAL_APP_ID=
ONESIGNAL_REST_API_KEY=
ONESIGNAL_USER_AUTH_KEY=
```

## Usage

There is a function for each of the OneSignal API calls.  They are broken down here.

**Note:** In all instances where an $app_id is asked for, omitting it will grab the default OneSignal App ID specified in the .env file
